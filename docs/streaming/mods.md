I use **[BS+](https://github.com/hardcpp/BeatSaberPlus)** with the Chat integration when streaming Beat Saber. This is what displays the Twitch chat in game, but it also has many other features.

As of writing this, the latest version of BS+ can be downloaded from here: <https://github.com/hardcpp/BeatSaberPlus/releases>
